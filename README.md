# Understanding-Data
The Python Libraries: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

In this experiment, I implemented a simple Single Layer Neural Network in order to solve a real wold machine learning problem with a real world data. 
In this experiment, I got familiar Python data science libraries such as; Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 
At the end, I trained the neural network to classify clinical cases to either benign or malignant.
